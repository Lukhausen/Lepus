This paper examines the application of reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning techniques to develop synthetic chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) benchmark. Current leading models achieve approximately 4% accuracy on this benchmark, underscoring the significant challenges in developing abstract reasoning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.\
\
The methodology employs a bifurcated reward function that evaluates structural and content components separately, drawing from established approaches in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (MORLAIF). Experiments with 3B and 7B parameter models investigate the potential for emergent reasoning capabilities when models receive incentives to produce extended reasoning chains. The approach utilizes data augmentation techniques that expand the original ARC dataset from 1,000 to approximately 28,000 tasks through geometric transformations and structural modifications.\
\
Experimental results indicate that while 3B parameter models demonstrated limited capacity to develop sophisticated reasoning patterns independently, targeted incentive mechanisms in 7B parameter models produced measurable improvements, yielding a 77% increase in reward scores during benchmarking. Despite these improvements, the models did not achieve substantial accuracy on the ARC-AGI benchmark, suggesting fundamental limitations in the current methodology.\
