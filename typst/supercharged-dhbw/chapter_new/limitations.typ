= Limitations and Future Research Directions

Our investigation into emergent reasoning capabilities in language models for abstract reasoning tasks revealed several constraints and opportunities for enhancement. This chapter systematically examines methodological refinements that could potentially improve performance on the ARC benchmark and advance our understanding of emergent reasoning in LLMs.

== Model Parameter Scaling

The most evident limitation of our current approach involves parameter scale constraints. Our experiments utilized models with parameter counts of 3 billion and 7 billion, both of which demonstrated limited capacity to develop the sophisticated reasoning patterns required for ARC tasks. Scaling to larger architectures with 14+ billion parameters could potentially determine whether the inherent reasoning capabilities required for spatial abstraction tasks emerge at specific parameter thresholds. Previous research suggests that certain cognitive capabilities in language models manifest only after reaching critical parameter densities, making this a promising direction for future investigation.

== Advanced Inference Optimization Strategies

While our research focused primarily on model training methodology rather than inference optimization, implementing multi-perspective inference would likely enhance performance substantially. Previous studies have demonstrated that transformation-based inference techniques—particularly those involving geometric manipulations such as rotation and mirroring—can significantly improve performance on ARC tasks. Our training data incorporated these transformations, but we did not leverage them during inference.

A particularly promising approach would involve:

1. Generating multiple task perspectives through systematic geometric transformations
2. Processing each perspective independently through the model
3. Implementing statistical consensus mechanisms to aggregate outputs across perspectives
4. Deriving final predictions through probability-weighted pixel-level voting

This methodology would leverage the model's accumulated knowledge across different spatial orientations, potentially overcoming orientation-specific pattern recognition limitations.

== Foundation Model Selection Optimization

Our research utilized base Qwen models as foundation architectures. However, initializing from models already fine-tuned for reasoning tasks could provide substantial performance advantages. Specifically, models such as NVIDIA's NeMo-Minitron series built on the LLaMA architecture have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities that could serve as a more effective starting point for reinforcement learning optimization.

The principal advantage of such pre-optimized foundation models lies in their established reasoning pathways, which our reinforcement learning approach could potentially enhance rather than develop from rudimentary capabilities. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that the model could independently develop reasoning strategies for ARC tasks without explicit instruction, particularly when incentivized through our thinking-reward mechanism.

== Tool Integration and Computational Augmentation

A methodological enhancement with significant potential involves integrating programmatic tools within the model's reasoning framework. Implementing a pipeline that enables the model to generate and execute code during inference could substantially enhance analytical capabilities. Such a system would allow the model to leverage mathematical libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas) to identify statistical patterns and correlations across examples.

This computational augmentation approach would shift the model's operation from pure reasoning to a hybrid system that combines language model capabilities with structured analytical tools. While this enhancement would likely require substantial additional computational resources, it presents a promising direction for overcoming the inherent limitations of pure-LLM approaches to abstract reasoning tasks.

== Conclusions on Emergent Capabilities

Our experimental findings provide insights regarding emergent reasoning capabilities in language models. The results indicate that while reasoning models can be developed with relatively modest computational resources, the emergence of sophisticated reasoning patterns appears contingent upon foundational model intelligence. In scenarios where the base model lacks sufficient cognitive capacity, reasoning patterns do not spontaneously emerge through reinforcement learning alone.

However, our most significant observation came from the training run incorporating explicit rewards for reasoning length, where we observed the emergence of more sophisticated analytical patterns. This suggests that while complete reasoning capabilities may not emerge spontaneously, they can be methodically cultivated through targeted incentive mechanisms that guide the model toward more structured analytical approaches.

These findings contribute to our understanding of the conditions necessary for emergent reasoning in large language models and highlight promising directions for future research in this domain.
