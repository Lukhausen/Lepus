= Use of AI in this Paper

As artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), continues to advance in capability, this paper acknowledges and strategically incorporates this technology. Computer scientists and society face two distinct options: either disregard AI's existence, potentially sacrificing productivity, code quality, documentation standards, and operational efficiency, or judiciously embrace it to enhance research methodologies where appropriate.\
This work does not utilize LLMs for direct content generation. This principled stance remains despite the recognition that, through various obfuscation techniques, artificially generated content has become increasingly difficult to detect or verify. Instead, AI serves an auxiliary function in this paper, primarily for identifying and correcting linguistic errors and suggesting alternative phrasings to enhance readability and comprehension. These suggestions have been selectively implemented to refine our writing, ensuring optimal clarity and coherence throughout the document.\
The specific tools employed include: @google2025aistudio, @openai2025api, @anthropic2025claude, and @grammarly2025editor. While disclosure of such technological assistance may not be formally required in academic publishing standards, we consider it essential to establish transparent practices regarding the utilization of generative tools in scholarly work. Therefore, despite the option to omit this information, we have included this statement to maintain intellectual integrity and transparency regarding the integration of generative AI in this research.


_As an example of the extent of changes introduced into this work, the original, unmodified paragraph is provided below:_

As artificial intelligence, especially large language models, are getting more capable by the second, this paper will make use of this technology. The reason for that is that we, as computer scientists and even as a society, have two options: either pretend that it does not exist and slowly fall behind in productivity, code quality, documentation quality, and efficiency, or we embrace it and use it where it can improve our work. We will not use large language models to generate content for this work, even if no one is capable (when applying clever obfuscation) of recognizing or checking if this work contains artificially generated content. We will use artificial intelligence to correct spelling and grammatical mistakes and have large language models suggest different, smoother, and better-to-understand versions of our sentences to improve readability and understandability. It may be a little too early to include this type of information in a project, but we are pretty sure that this needs to become a standard practice of declaring what kind of generative AI was used in the creation of any written work. So even though this paragraph could have been left out completely, we decided to put it in to be transparent and honest about the use of generative tools in this work.

#note[
All AI-suggested text incorporated into this paper was manually reviewed and edited by the authors. We have ensured that no factual inaccuracies, misrepresentations, or hallucinated content introduced by AI are present. All citations were human-inserted following verification. The provided example illustrates precisely how AI-suggested edits were further refined manually before inclusion.
